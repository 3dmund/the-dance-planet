						<li><em>Apollo's Angels</em> by Jennifer Homans
							<p>"Unique among the arts, ballet has no written texts or standardized notation. It is a storytelling art passed on from teacher to student. A ballerina dancing today is a link in a long chain of dancers stretching back to sixteenth-century Italy and France: Her graceful movements recall a lost world of courts, kings, and aristocracy, but her steps are also marked by the dramatic changes in dance and culture that followed."</p>

						<li><em>Ballerina: Sex, Scandal, and Suffering Behind the Symbol of Perfection</em> by Deirdre Kelly
							<p>"Throughout her history, the ballerina has been perceived as the embodiment of beauty and perfection - she is the feminine ideal. But the reality is another story. Beginning with the earliest ballerinas, who often led double lives as concubines, Deirdre Kelly goes on to review the troubled lives of 19th-century ballerinas, who lived in poverty and worked under torturous and even life-threatening conditions. In the 20th century, George Balanchine created a contradictory ballet culture that simultaneously idealized and oppressed ballerinas, and many of his dancers suffered from anorexia and bulimia or underwent cosmetic surgery to achieve the ideal ethereal form."</p>
							<p>Editor's review: This is one of the darker, more mature books. For a greater understanding of the history and symbol of the ballerina, this is a great read.</p>
